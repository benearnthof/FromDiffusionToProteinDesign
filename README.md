A collection of Literature and notes I took when reading each paper. Each markdown document is compatible with obsidian, you can just clone the repo and open it in the obsidian text editor. The general idea is to connect diffusion processes with generative models and highlight mathematical connections when appropriate. Once the reader gets to Flow Matching the path to modern proteomics is pretty straightforward (at least from the perspective of statistical learning and deep generative models). 

If you have questions or paper suggestions or find mistakes or stuff that is unclear please raise an issue, this is very much a work in progress.
